      <h2>Rules Onboard the bus</h2>
      <p>It is imperative for the safety and comfort of all passengers that they remain seated while the bus is in motion, with the exception of accessing the onboard restroom facilities. This measure is implemented to mitigate the risk of injury and ensure a smooth journey.</p>
      <p>In compliance with federal law, smoking is strictly prohibited onboard. Scheduled stops are designated for smoking breaks to accommodate passengers who wish to indulge in this activity.</p>
      <p>Passengers are reminded to refrain from capturing photos, videos, or audio recordings of TicketRide staff, equipment, or procedures. This policy is in place to respect the privacy and professionalism of our staff members.</p>
      <p>Alcohol, drugs, and weapons are strictly prohibited anywhere onboard, including in under-bus baggage. This policy is enforced to maintain a safe and secure environment for all passengers and staff.</p>
      <p>Disruptive behavior, such as shouting or causing disturbances, is unacceptable. Passengers are expected to maintain a calm and respectful demeanor throughout the journey, ensuring a pleasant experience for everyone onboard.</p>
      <p>With the exception of legitimate service animals accompanying disabled individuals, pets are not allowed onboard. Passengers seeking further information on this policy are encouraged to refer to our contact form.</p>
      <h2>U.S. Customs and Border Protection Procedures</h2>
      <p>For passengers traveling within the state of Washington, it's crucial to be aware of potential immigration enforcement activities that may affect travel experiences. If you encounter Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents during your journey, please note the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is hereby declared and affirmed that TicketRide, herein referred to as the "Company," unequivocally and categorically does not grant consent to any form of warrantless immigration enforcement checks, whether conducted onboard its buses or within the confines of non-public areas of its terminals. This stance is rooted in a steadfast commitment to safeguarding the rights and privacy of its passengers, in strict adherence to the laws and regulations governing such matters.</li>
        <li>As a passenger of TicketRide, you are vested with certain inalienable rights during encounters with immigration agents, herein referred to as the "Authorities." These rights, bestowed upon you by virtue of your status as an individual subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, include but are not limited to: the inviolable right to remain silent, the sacred right to seek legal counsel, and the sacrosanct right to withhold consent to searches of your personal belongings. It is imperative that you acquaint yourself with these rights to ensure the preservation of your legal protections and liberties.</li>
        <li>The Company staunchly denounces and condemns any and all discriminatory practices predicated upon race or ethnicity in the execution of law enforcement activities by the Authorities. Such practices, contravening the foundational principles of equality and justice enshrined in the Constitution of the United States, are unequivocally illegal and reprehensible. In the event that you, as a passenger, are subjected to or witness such discriminatory conduct, you are encouraged to exercise your rights and seek redress through appropriate legal channels. Complaints regarding civil rights violations may be lodged with the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) or directly with the Customs and Border Protection (CBP).</li>
        <li>For passengers seeking additional assistance and resources in matters pertaining to immigration enforcement activities, a plethora of avenues exist for recourse and support. Organizations such as the esteemed American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and various legal service providers specializing in immigration matters stand ready to offer aid and advocacy. It is incumbent upon the Company to ensure that passengers are apprised of these resources, thereby empowering them to assert their rights and access the assistance they require.</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>By understanding and adhering to these guidelines, we can ensure a pleasant and hassle-free journey for all passengers aboard TicketRide buses.</p>
